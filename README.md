# Vision Jarvis

Vision Jarvis is an advanced AI-powered hand gesture and voice interaction system designed for seamless smart home and automation control. It integrates computer vision, speech recognition, and context-aware automation to provide a futuristic, multimodal user experience.

## Key Features
- **Hand Gesture Recognition:** Real-time detection and interpretation of complex hand gestures using deep learning and computer vision.
- **Voice Assistant:** Natural language understanding and speech synthesis for hands-free control and feedback.
- **Context Awareness:** Adaptive responses based on user context, environment, and intent.
- **Smart Home Integration:** Control of IoT devices, appliances, and routines via gestures or voice.
- **Augmented Reality Interface:** Holographic UI overlays and AR feedback for immersive interaction.
- **Memory & Personalization:** Learns user preferences, adapts to routines, and stores episodic/contextual memory.
- **Security & Privacy:** Biometric authentication, secure communications, and privacy controls.
- **Modular Architecture:** Easily extensible with new modules for automation, object detection, and more.
